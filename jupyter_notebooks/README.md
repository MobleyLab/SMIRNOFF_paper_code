## Manifest
- [`visualize_torsions.ipynb`](visualize_torsions.ipynb): Jupyter notebook which generates molecules corresponding to the set for which we examined nitrogen pyramidalization (as shown in the Figure in the paper, with several additional examples) which creates SMIRKS patterns to match/categorize the several categories of pyramidalization and verifies that the molecules are categorized correctly. From Caitlin Bannan.
