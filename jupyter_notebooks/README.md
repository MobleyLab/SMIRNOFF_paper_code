# Jupyter notebooks relating to SMIRNOFF paper

## Manifest
- [`visualize_torsions.ipynb`](visualize_torsions.ipynb): Jupyter notebook which generates molecules corresponding to the set for which we examined nitrogen pyramidalization (as shown in the Figure in the paper, with several additional examples) which creates SMIRKS patterns to match/categorize the several categories of pyramidalization and verifies that the molecules are categorized correctly. From Caitlin Bannan.
- [`aromatic_bondorders.ipynb`](aromatic_bondorders.ipynb): Jupyter notebook used to calculate bond orders for molecules the typical chemist would consider aromatic. Used to demonstrate why five-membered rings with hetro-atoms are not treated as aromatic with SMIRNOFF99Frosst. From Caitlin Bannan
