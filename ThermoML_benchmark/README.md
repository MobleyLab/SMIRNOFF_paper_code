# Density/dielectric constant benchmarks

## Overview

As part of this study, we ran a benchmark on densities/dielectric constants of a set of molecules from NIST's ThermoML, as previously reported in this study from the Chodera lab.
Code for that study is available at [LiquidBenchmark](https://github.com/choderalab/LiquidBenchmark) on the Chodera Lab GitHub site; however, dependencies have gone out of date and the code needed cleanup, so author Kyle Beauchamp helped get the code working again and made it available at [https://github.com/kyleabeauchamp/B2](https://github.com/kyleabeauchamp/B2).
We also worked with him to extend it to be compatible with the SMIRNOFF format.
Here, we used versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 of this updated benchmark code to run and analyze our density and dielectric constant calculations for GAFF (v0.0.1) and SMIRNOFF (v0.0.2).
Those releases of Kyle Beauchamp's code are archived here.
Additionally, we provide run settings used when conducting the simulations.


## Manifest
